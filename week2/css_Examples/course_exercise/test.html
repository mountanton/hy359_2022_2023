			A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a sequence of operations can be 
			readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.

						Conventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU), and some form of memory. 
						The processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in 
						response to stored information. Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, and the result of operations saved and retrieved.
		Contrary to popular belief, computers existed from antiquity. Any tool used for calculation could be referred to as a computer. The earliest computers were tally sticks in use 
		since around 20,000 BC. Mechanical analog computers started appearing in first century and were used in the medieval era for astronomical calculations. In World War II, 
		mechanical analog computers were used for specialized military applications. During this time the first electronic digital computers were developed. Originally they 
		were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers (PCs).[1]
		Modern computers based on integrated circuits are millions to billions of times more capable than the early machines, and occupy a fraction of the space.[2] Simple computers 
		are small enough to fit into mobile devices, and mobile computers can be powered by small batteries. Personal computers in their various forms are icons of the Information Age 
		and are what most people think of as computers. However, the embedded computers found in many devices from MP3 players to fighter aircraft and from toys to industrial robots are 
		the most numerous.
